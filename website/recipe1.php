                        Jumping on the Royal Wedding bandwagon, I was tasked with making the Royal Wedding fridge cake for a tea party.<br/>
                        Having lived in England for a brief period of time, I am ashamed to say that I had no idea what the cake was
                        supposed to be like; texture, taste etc. Online research also did not indicate whether it was supposed to be extra
                        sweet, crunchy, etc.<br/><br/>
                        So, I winged it, envisioning a chewy fudge with a slightly crunchy inside, the sweetness coming more from raisins.
                        Some of the recipes called for nuts, but I omitted them since I'm not particularly a fan. <br/><br/>

                        Enjoy!
                        <br/><br/>Here's the recipe:<br/><br/>
                        <span class="makes">Gateau a la Royale</span><br/>
                        Makes 1 Cake<br/><br/>
                        Line an 8" square pan with cling wrap.<br/>
                        Soak the raisins in hot water for about 20 minutes, then drain the liquid off. <br/>
                        Place the biscuits in a large gallon zip lock bag, seal it, and bash it with a rolling pin, leaving some quarter
                        sized pieces (do this step manually, and don't use a food processor). <br/><br/>
                        Combine the condensed milk, cream and corn syrup in a saucepan and bring to a boil.<br/>
                        Chop the butter up into smaller pieces and place it in a bowl with the chocolate chips.<br/>
                        Pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate, and stir until well combined.<br/>
                        Leave the chocolate mixture to cool until room temperature.<br/>
                        Combine the crushed biscuits, raisins and chocolate mixture until everything is well coated with
                        chocolate.<br/><br/>

                        Pour in the pan, level the top and freeze for about 2-3 hours, or until firm.<br/>
                        Slice with a sharp knife to serve.<br/>
                    </p>
